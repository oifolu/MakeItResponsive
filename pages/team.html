    <h1>Our team</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Lasse</h4>

<p>
  Lasse is our CEO and compulsive bad-joke-teller.<br>
  He has been working with innovation for the last 15 years and has a burning passion for spreading all the knowledge he has accumulated, both between the team and to our clients.
  <br>While he and his partner has no kids, they treat their Dachsen hound like it was a royal heir.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>Chaima</h5>

<p>
  Chaima is our Project Lead. <br>
  She has an infectious laugh that puts Covid-19 to shame and is impossible not to enjoy being around.
  <br>Besides that, she has a brilliantly sharp mind and finds solutions in any scenario you pitch her. <br>
  She is our go-to-gal when noone else knows what to do.<br>
  Off-work, you can expect to find Chaima at the local Bowling alley where she is on first name basis with everyone there. <br>
  In other words; do NOT challenge Chaima to a bowling match if you think loosing might affect your sense of pride.
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h6>Else</h6>

</picture>

<p>
  Else is our founder and the company's backbone. <br>
  She pulled the team together and in an inspirational speech that would be worthy of any 80's B-movie, she deserves the credit for us mustering up the courage to form this company together.<br>
  Else has 8 years of experience with working with innovation in emerging markets, and has a specialized skillset that few can match. <br>
  When she is not working, Else spends all her freetime watching YouTube cat movies, which makes us wonder why she has no cats. It seriously boggles our minds and pushes us closer and closer to the verge of insanity.

  <img src="../images/sundar.png" alt="This is a picture of our Key Account Manager, Sundar" width="75%">
</picture>

<p>
  Sundar is our key account manager and in-house superhero.<br>
  He knows basically everything about everyone working in any company all over the world. <br>
  It never seizes to amaze us how Sundar constantly grows our network of clients and partners and manages to remember the name of everyone he meets - yet he always "forgets" to put the office toilet seat down. <br>
  Due to his extreme workefficiency, we have long suspected that he has at least 2 or three clones but we have yet to find any hard evidence of this. <br>
  Sundar had a short stint on the bicycle this past summer, but as of recently it seems that he has fallen back to his most favourite past-time of all; creating the most mouth watering and jealousy-inducing pastries on earth.
