    <h1>Our Innovation Camps</h1>
    <p>On this page we will post our upcoming Innovation Camps. A rule of thumb is that we will host an "afternoon camp" the first wednesday of each month at our offices. Besides that we will try to attend bigger conferences and make our presence known at other relevant venues. And as always, if you want us to customize a training/study camp for your businees or school - please do not hesitate to <a href="../pages/contact.html"><strong> Contact Us</strong></a>.</p>

        “The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, industry and frugality: that is, waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both. <br> Without industry and frugality nothing will do, and with them everything.”<br>
        &mdash; Benjamin Franklin.
