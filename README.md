 Inova Frugal Innovation

Project Introduction:

 Inova is a newly formed company in need of a website. Their business is focused around frugal innovation, and in order to spread their experience with frugal innovation, they want to host innovation camps. They are open to suggestions on what their website should look like and include, but they ask that it at least includes:
 -	Information about the company and what they do.
 -	Information about the staff members (Please create your own fantasy staff)
 -	Schedule for the future innovation camps
 -	Contact information
 Inova really cares about accessibility and universal design, and they therefore ask that their new website is designed to be accessible to all.

Project responsibilities:

By agreement with Anthony I'm working on this assignment on my own. As such I will complete all tasks on this assignment.

Inova has specified 4 "feature requests" for their website:

- Information about the company
- Information about the staff
- Schedule for innovation camps
- Contact Information

Keeping in line with the "frugal" spirit of the company I think it is best to not exceed these features unnecessarily. "Less is more".
So initially my instinct tells me to not go beyond these requests. However that might change as I work on the project.

Universal Design is a main focus for Inova, and as such I want the website to be as easily accessible, maneuverable  and intuitive as possible.

From the business case I see that their main objective is to host innovation camps and this is the "feature" I believe should be the most accessible when browsing the site.

Initially I believe that at least 99% of this assignment can be solved with HTML and CSS only, however I see that a calendar feature that enables browsing future events might require some JavaScript, especially if I work in a "booking feature" as well.

The same might apply for any "Contact forms". My main objective however is to keep this site
